I’m a Business Intelligence & Data Analyst with a background you don’t see every day: 7+ years in education, now focused on turning data into clear, practical insight.

Recently, I completed a project-based BI Analytics bootcamp (TripleTen), where I worked with Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to clean data, build dashboards, and support data-driven decisions. My projects have included analyzing Airbnb rentals in Manhattan and exploring retail return patterns to understand their impact on customer retention and satisfaction.

Before BI, I spent years in the classroom as an elementary and middle school teacher. In practice, that meant using data every day: tracking student performance, monitoring engagement, adjusting “strategy” based on results, and communicating progress clearly to parents and school leadership. It also meant building strong relationships, staying calm under pressure, and showing up consistently; I’m proud of a spotless attendance record and a reputation for reliability.

What hasn’t changed in this transition is how I work: with sincerity, perseverance, curiosity, and a real sense of responsibility for the people who are counting on me. What has changed are the tools I use and the problems I’m solving.
